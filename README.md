# Makers Academy Week 1 - Boris Bikes
This was the first of our weekly pairing projects set on the Makers Academy course.

The project consists of 22 challenges, each building on one another. The aim of the project was to teach us how to get stuck, research effectively and find our own solutions. It also introduced us to TDD (we used a testing framework for the first time - rspec) and OOP.

The program simulates the Boris Bikes network and associated infrastructure (docking stations, vans, repair staff etc.).

### Usage ###
Docking stations and bikes can be created and be used together as follows:
